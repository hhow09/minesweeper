# Minesweeper

Implement the classic Windows game Minesweeper with React.

[Live Demo](https://hhow09.github.io/minesweeper/)

## Rules

1. Clicking a mine ends the game.
2. Clicking a square with an adjacent mine clears that square and shows the number of mines touching it.
3. Clicking a square with no adjacent mine clears that square and clicks all adjacent squares.
4. The first click will never be a mine.
5. It will clear the map and place numbers on the grid.
6. The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.
